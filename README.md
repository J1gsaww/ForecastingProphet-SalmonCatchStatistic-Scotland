    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>This section provides an overview of the project and its objectives.</p>
    <h2 id="data-exploration">Data Exploration</h2>
    <p>Exploratory data analysis was conducted to understand the structure and characteristics of the data.</p>
    <h2 id="data-cleaning">Data Cleaning</h2>
    <p>The data was cleaned and prepared for analysis, including handling missing values and outliers.</p>
    <h2 id="data-analysis">Data Analysis</h2>
    <p>The data analysis includes the following components:</p>
    <h3>Amount of Each Type of Fish Caught in Each Year</h3>
